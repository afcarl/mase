# Reading Research Papers

<img src="img/dogreading.jpg" align=right>

As technologies change, technologists need to
continually update their technical knowledge.
The problem with that is that reading all the latest research is very hard.
Working through complex technical papers is a complex and technical task.
For example, if you ask new graduate students to read ten papers in a particular sub-field:

+ It can take a full day to read the first paper.
+ But after reading ten papers, they can do it much faster.

## How to Read Papers, Faster

There are two keys to reading papers faster:

+ _Context:_Experts can read papers faster when they know of other work in the field and can place this new
paper into the context of other work. 
+ _Feature extraction:_  Experts are experts at anything since they know what to look for, and what can be skipped over. This is true for many tasks, including reading:
    + Experts do not read entire papers, word for word.
    + Rather, they hunt and peek looking for [certain key features](READINGrubric.md).


<img src="img/sboard.png" width=400 align=right>
To put that another way,  papers are not read for _repeatability_ (of the whole paper) but for _reusability_ of their parts. 
Technical papers are really a
  presentation of [many connected technical concepts](READINGrubric.md),
some of which the reader will extract and apply to their own work.
So  we should not read papers so we can paint them again as beautiful complete works of art.
Rather, we should treat them as a design of some complex product...

+ Which can be exploded into [various parts](READINGrubric.md)...
+ ... any of which might be repurposed in other areas.

To put that another way, we should not _read_ papers but we should _survey_ them, to

+ Map out their [internal structure](READINGrubric.md)
+ To find and extract whatever [parts](READINGrubric.md) might be useful to use.

Of course, once we find the (little) bits that we really want to use, then we might spend hours/days struggling
to understand those (small) parts. But otherwise, we need to read _over_ papers, not _through_ them. 

## Exercises In Reading Faster

In the following, anything in italics will be explained later.

Note that, at first, it will take _hours_ to read one paper. However, after a couple your reading will speed
up dramatically. So do not be discouraged if, at first, this is ridiculously slow.

### Part1 (nine small tasks)

+ Week1: Find a highly cited paper from the automated software engineering literature
     + Go  [here](https://goo.gl/HqOVJ1)
     + Pick any 2011 paper and _summarize some of its parts_.
+ Week2,3,4,5: Walk backwards
     + Find four papers in the week1's reference list
          + That date 2008 to 2010
	      + That are _highly cited_
	  + Walk them backwards in time, one per week, _summarizing some of there parts_
+ Week6,7,8,9: Walk forwards
      + Find four papers that cite the week1 paper
          + That date 2012 to 2015
	      + That are _highly cited_.
      + Walk them forwards in time, one per week, _summarizing some of there parts_

### Part2 (one big essay)

Take all the above and summarize the procession of research 2008 to 2015 of some automated software
engineering issue.

+ For full marks,
+ 10 pages, 2 columns,  using the Word or Latex formats shown in [this page](https://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates).
+ Include at least 18 references, nine of which are the nine shown above

Note: if your Part1 nine papers proved to be dull, fell free to start again with some other 2011 paper from
[here](https://goo.gl/HqOVJ1).
