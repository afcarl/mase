# Reading Research Papers


As technologies change, technologists need to
continually update their technical knowledge.
The problem with that is that reading all the latest research is very hard.
Working through complex technical papers is a complex and technical task.
For example, if you ask new graduate students to read ten papers in a particular sub-field:

+ It can take a full day to read the first paper.
+ But after reading ten papers, they can do it much faster.

There are two keys to reading papers faster:

+ _Context:_Experts can read papers faster when they know of other work in the field and can place this new
paper into the context of other work.
+ _Feature extraction:_  Experts are experts at anything since they know what to look for, and what can be skipped over.

This second points needs a little explanation:

+ Experts do not read entire papers, word for word.
+ Rather, they hunt and peek looking for certain
key features.
+ So papers are not read for _repeatability_ (of the whole paper) but for _reusability_ of their parts.
    + Technical papers are really a presentation of many connected technical concepts...
    + .... Some of which the reader will extract and apply to their own work.
	
Hence,  we should not read papers so we can paint them again as beautiful complete works of art. Rather, we should throw rocks at technical papers, shatter them, then pick up the useful features.

To but that another way, we should not _read_ papers but we should _survey_ them to find and extract
whatever parts are useful to use.
