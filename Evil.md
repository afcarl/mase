#  Evil Code for Wicked Problems (or, part4 of "how to take over the world") 

+ <img width=200 align=right src="http://d364y98vz4769w.cloudfront.net/drawings/images/000/081/152/full/image-392503509.jpg?1370810709"> _"The world is a dangerous place to live, not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it."_     
― Albert Einstein

The evil plan (by programmers) to take over the world is progressing nicely.  Certain parts of that plan were initially somewhat  undefined (specifically, part4). However, given recent results, this book can now fill in the details.

But first, a little history.  As all programmers know, the initial parts of the plan were completed years ago. Part one was to adopt a meek and mild persona (possibly even boring and dull). 

Part two was, under the guise of that persona, ingratiated ourselves to government and indistrial agenices (education, mining, manufacturing, etc etc). Once there, make our work essential to their day to day opertion. Looking around the world today, it it is plain to see that part two was very successful.

After that, part three was to make much more material available for our inspection and manipluation. To this end, the entire planet was enclosed  a digital network- thus giving us unprecendented access to petabytes of sensors and effectors. Also, by carefully seeding a few promienet  examples of successful programmers (Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerburg), we convinced a lot of people to write lots of little tools, each of which represent or control some thing, somewhere.

Part four was a little tricky but, as shown in this book, it turned out not to be too hard. A

Learn ways to simplify those  processes such that it becomes
   trivially fast to plan how to change them, in order to achieve
   your own goals. 
6. Deploy those changes, thus taking over the world.

Note the truly evil, very wicked and distrubring part of this plan:

+ If you have the power to change the world then that also means  (evil laugh) you    have the guilt if you do not use that power to right the wrongs in this world.  
+ So my gift to you is  discontent and struggle and the occasional (possibly fleeting) success against vast problems.
