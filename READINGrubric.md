# Reading Rubrix

When reading a researech paper, it is possible extract certain information from a paper

## Background Data


## Parts Within a Paper

<table>
<tr><td>
1. Motivational statements   </td><td>reports or challenge statements or lists of open issues that prompt an analysis;</td></tr>
<tr><td>2. Hypotheses </td><td>Expected effects in some area;.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3. Checklists </td><td>Used to design the analysis (see also, the [Checklist Manifesto](http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/);.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4. Related Work </td><td> Comprehensive, annotated, and insightful (e.g. showing the development or open areas in a field);.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5. Study instruments </td><td>e.g. surveys interview scripts, etc;.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6. Statistical tests </td><td> Mathematical tools  to analyze results (along with some notes explaining why or when this test is necessary);.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7. Commentary  </td><td> About the  scripts used in the analysis;.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8. Informative visualizations  </td><td> e.g. Sparklines http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msgid=0001OR .</td></tr>
<tr><td>9. Baseline results  </td><td> Results against which new work can be compared;.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10. Sampling procedures </td><td> e.g. ``how did you choose the projects you studied?'';.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11. Patterns</td><td> describing  best practices for performing this kind of analysis; .</td></tr>
<tr><td>Anti-patterns  </td><td>  describing cautionary tales of ``gotchas'' to avoid when doing this kind of work;
<tr><td>12. Negative results  </td><td> Anti-patterns, backed up by empirical results;.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13. Tutorial materials  </td><td> Guides to help  newcomers become proficient in the area. Some of these tutorial materials  may be generated by the researcher and others may be collected from other sources..</td></tr>
<tr><td>14. New results   </td><td> Guidance on how to best handle future problems..</td></tr>
<tr><td>15. Future work:   </td><td> Based on the  results,  speculations about open issues of future issues that might become the  motivation  for the next round of research.
</td></tr></table>

## Parts that papers might point too

<table>
<tr><td>
16.  Data  </td><td> Used in an analysis; either  raw from a project;
or some derived product.</td></tr>

<tr><td>
17. Scripts   </td><td> used to perform the analysis (the main analysis or the subsequent statistical tests or visualizations; e.g.    the  [Python Sparklines generator](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysparklines)). Scripts can also implement some of the patterns
  identified by the paper.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>18. Sample  models </td><td>Can generate exemplar data;  or which offer an executable form of current hypotheses. Or, these models could be a set of standard problems everyone shares
  (e.g. the verification comminity and optimization community have
libraries of standard models (or models ported from commercial apps) that they all use to baseline their 
tools)</td></tr>
<tr><td>29. Delivery tools </td><td> Things that let other people automatically rerun the analysis; e.g.
    + Config management files that can
       + build the system/ paper from raw material and/or
       + update the relevant files using some package manager
       +  Virtual machines containing all the above scripts, data, etc, pre-configured such that a newcomer can automatically run the old analysis. </td></tr>
