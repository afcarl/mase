# Reading Rubrix

When reading a researech paper, it is possible extract certain information from a paper

## Background Data


## Parts Within a Paper

<table>
<tr><td>
1. _Motivational statements_   </td><td>reports or challenge statements or lists of open issues that prompt an analysis; .</td></tr>
<tr><td>2. _Hypotheses_ </td><td>Expected effects in some area;.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3. _Checklists_ </td><td>Used to design the analysis (see also, the [Checklist Manifesto](http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/);.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4. _Related Work_ </td><td> Comprehensive, annotated, and insightful (e.g. showing the development or open areas in a field);.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5. _Study instruments_ </td><td>e.g. surveys interview scripts, etc;.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6. _Statistical tests_ </td><td> Mathematical tools  to analyze results (along with some notes explaining why or when this test is necessary);.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7. _Commentary_  </td><td> About the  scripts used in the analysis;.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8. _Informative visualizations_  </td><td> e.g. Sparklines http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR .</td></tr>
<tr><td>9. _Baseline results_  </td><td> Results against which new work can be compared;.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10. _Sampling procedures_ </td><td> e.g. ``how did you choose the projects you studied?'';.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11. _Patterns_ describing  best practices for performing this kind of analysis; .</td></tr>
<tr><td>_Anti-patterns_  </td><td>  describing cautionary tales of ``gotchas'' to avoid when doing this kind of work;
<tr><td>12. _Negative results_  </td><td> Anti-patterns, backed up by empirical results;.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13. _Tutorial materials_  </td><td> Guides to help  newcomers become proficient in the area. Some of these tutorial materials  may be generated by the researcher and others may be collected from other sources..</td></tr>
<tr><td>14. _New results_   </td><td> Guidance on how to best handle future problems..</td></tr>
<tr><td>15. _Future work:_   </td><td> Based on the  results,  speculations about open issues of future issues that might become the  motivation  for the next round of research.
</td></tr></table>

## Parts that papers might point too

<table>
<tr><td>
16.  _Data_  </td><td> Used in an analysis; either  _raw_ from a project;
or some _derived_ product.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17. _Sample Models_  </td><td> </td></tr>
<tr><td>
18. _Scripts_   </td><td> used to perform the analysis (the main analysis or the subsequent statistical tests or visualizations; e.g.    the  [Python Sparklines generator](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysparklines)). Scripts can also implement some of the patterns
  identified by the paper.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>19. _Sample  models_ </td><td>Can generate exemplar data;  or which offer an executable form of current hypotheses. Or, these models could be a set of standard problems everyone shares
  (e.g. the verification comminity and optimization community have
libraries of standard models (or models ported from commercial apps) that they all use to baseline their 
tools)</td></tr>
<tr><td>20. _Delivery tools_ to let novices automatically rerun the analysis; e.g.
    + Config management files that can
       + build the system/ paper from raw material and/or
       + update the relevant files using some package manager
       +  Virtual machines containing all the above scripts, data, etc, pre-configured such that a newcomer can automatically run the old analysis. </td></tr>
