# Welcome to the Evil Plan

__"The world is a dangerous place to live, not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it."__ - Albert Einstein

The evil plan (by programmers) to take over the
world is progressing nicely. Certain parts of that
plan were initially somewhat undefined. However, given recent
results, this book can now fill in the missing details from part4 of that plan.

But first, a little history. As all programmers
know, this plan is now decades old.
Part one was for programmers to adopt a meek and mild
persona (possibly even boring and dull).

Part two was, under the guise of that persona,
ingratiated ourselves to government and indistrial
agenices (education, mining, manufacturing, etc
etc). Once there, make our work essential to their
day to day opertion. 
Software is now a prime driven in innovation and all aspects of economic development.
Software mediates most aspects of our daily lives such as the
stock market models that control
the economy; the probablistic models that recommend what books to read;
and the pacemakers that govern the beating of our heart.


After that, part three was to make  more
material available for our inspection and
manipluation. To this end, the planet was
enclosed a digital network that grants us
unprecendented access to petabytes of sensors and
effectors. Also, by carefully seeding a few
promienet examples of successful programmers (Gates,  Jobs, Zuckerburg, thanks guys!), we convinced a
lot of people to write lots of little tools, each of
which represent or control some thing, somewhere.

Part four was a little tricky but, as shown in this
book, it turned out not to be too hard.  Having
access to many models and much data can be
overwhelming-- unless some GREAT SECRET can be used
to significantly simply all that information. For
the longest time, that GREAT SECRET was
unknown. However, recent advances have revealed that
if we describe something in _N_ dimensions, then
there is usually a much smaller set of _M_
dimensions that contain most of the signal. So
GREAT SECRET is that is it very easy (and very fast) to
find then exploit those few number of _M_
dimensions for solving seemingly complex problems.

\end{wrapfigure}With those controllers in hand, we
are now free to move to part five; i.e. taking over
the world.  The truly evil part of this
work is this:
_now you know you have the power to change the world_.
This also means that (evil laugh)
_now you have the guilt if you do not use that power to right the wrongs of the world_.
So welcome to a lifetime of discontent (punctuated by the occasionaly, perhaps fleerting, truimphs) as you struggle to solve a very large number of pressing
problems facing humanity.

'Nough said. Good luck with that whole
world domination thing. One tip: if at first you cannot dominate the whole
thing, start out with something smaller.
Find some people who have problems, then work with them to
make changes that help them.
Remember: if you don't try then you won't be able to sleep
at night.
Ever again (evil laugh).
