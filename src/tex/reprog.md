## Research Programming

Silliness aside, this book is about how to be a _research programmer_.
Research programmer's understand the world by:

+ Codify out current understanding of "it" into a model.
+ Reasoning about the model.

We take this term "research programmer" from Ph.D. Steve Guao's 2012 dissertation.


### Challenges with Research Programming

Research programming sounds simple, right? Well, there's a catch (actually, there are
several catches).

Firstly, models have to be written and it can be quite a task to create and validate a model
of some complex phenomenon.

see also list in sbse14

Secondly, many models related to
\emph{wicked problems}; i.e.~problems for which there is no clear best
solution. Tittel XXXWorse still, some models relate to \_wicked there is
final matter of the \emph{goals} that humans want to achieve with those
models. When those goals are contradictory (which happens, all too
often), then our model-based tools must negotiate complex trade offs
between different possibilities.

Thirdly, if wicked problems were not eough, there is also the issue of
uncertainty. Many real world models contain large areas of uncertainty,
especially if that model relates to something that humans have only been
studying for a few decades.

Fourthly, even  if you are still not worried about the effectiveness of reserach
problem, consider the complexity of real-world phenomonem. Many of these
models are so complex that we cannot predict what happens when the parts
of that model interact.

### Parts

+ Domain specifc langauges (representation)
+ execution (nuktu-objective ootiization)
+ evaluation (statistical methods for experimental sciencetists in SE)
+ Philophsopy (about what it means to know, and to doubt)

### Implications for Software Engineering


Note that research programming  changes the nature and focus and role of
21st century software engineering:

+ Traditionally, software engineering is about services
  that meet requirements.
+ But with research programming, software engineering is less about
  service than about search. Research programming's goal is the discovery 
  of interesting features in existing models
  (or  perhaps even the evolution of entirely 
  new kinds of models).

For example, old-fashioned software engineerings
might explore small
things like strings or "hello world". But with research programmers
explore **BIG** things like String Theory or
"hello world model of climate change and economic
impacts".
