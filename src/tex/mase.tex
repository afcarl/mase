 \subsection*{About this book} This book is a  ``how to'' guide about model-based reasoning using
   data mining and search-based tools (with examples taken from software engineering).
   It is intended for graduate  students taking
  a one semester subject in advanced programming methods as
  well as researchers developing the next generation
  of model-based reasoning tools.  

  Using Python 2.7, the book builds (from the ground up) numerous
  tiny tools that can tame seemingly complex
  tasks. The combined toolkit, called RINSE, offers four kinds of functionality:
  \be
  \item
    It {\em \underline{r}epresents}  models using domain-specific languages;
    \item It supports
    {\em \underline{in}ference} across the multiple goals of those models using multi-objective optimization.
    \item It shows how to succinctly {\em \underline{s}ummarize} that inference  using data miners;
    \item It has  many tools for the
   {\em \underline{e}valuation} of different inference methods. 
   \ee
   
   RINSE is a not some shiny  end-user click-and-point GUI package.
   Rather, it is a starter-kit that demonstrates an novel  model-based approach to problem solving where programmers
   mix and match and extend data miners and multi-objective optimizers.

   RINSE was written using the mantra ``less is more''. Whenever it was found that small parts of the
   the code handled most 
   of the functionality, then the extra functionality was ejected. This resulted in a (very) small code base
   which can be readily browsed, learned, taught, and changed.

   \subsection*{Content Advisory }
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{1.5in}
  \includegraphics[width=1.5in]{img/shark.jpg}
  \end{wrapfigure}
This book contains strong language, weakly typed (and tapped with glee).

This book may contain excessive or gratutious fun--
as well as ideas that some readers may (or may not) find disturbing.
This book does not necessarily 
believed or endorse those ideas- but plays with them anyway
(and asks you to do the same).

This book may include heresies, not suitable for anyone  who believes in established wisdom, without
adequate experimentation. It is
intended for mature audiences only; i.e.  those
old enough to know there is much left to know. 

This book may (or may not) contain peanuts or tree nut products.

Batteries not included.

Tim Menzies (Ph.D., UNSW, 1995, http://menzies.us) is a full Professor in CS at North Carolina State University where he teaches software engineering and automated software engineering. His research relates to synergies between human and artificial intelligence, with particular application to data mining for software engineering.

In his career, he has been a lead researcher on projects for NSF, NIJ, DoD, NASA, USDA, as well as joint research work with private companies.
He is the author of over 230 referred publications; and is one of the 100 most cited authors in software engineering out of over 80,000 researchers.

Prof. Menzies is an associate editor of IEEE
Transactions on Software Engineering, Empirical
Software Engineering and the Automated Software
Engineering Journal. His community service includes
co-founder of the PROMISE project (storing data for repeatable SE
experiments);
co-program chair for the 2012 conference on Automated SE and the 2015
New Ideas and Emerging Research track at the International Conference on SE;
and 
co-general chair for 2016 International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution.
