# Reading Research Papers

<img src="img/dogreading.jpg" align=right>

As technologies change, technologists need to
continually update their technical knowledge.
The problem with that is that reading all the latest research is very hard.
Working through complex technical papers is a complex and technical task.
For example, if you ask new graduate students to read ten papers in a particular sub-field:

+ It can take a full day to read the first paper.
+ But after reading ten papers, they can do it much faster.

## How to Read Papers, Faster

There are two keys to reading papers faster:

+ _Context:_Experts can read papers faster when they know of other work in the field and can place this new
paper into the context of other work. 
+ _Feature extraction:_  Experts are experts at anything since they know what to look for, and what can be skipped over. This is true for many tasks, including reading:
    + Experts do not read entire papers, word for word.
    + Rather, they hunt and peek looking for certain key features.


To put that another way,  papers are not read for _repeatability_ (of the whole paper) but for _reusability_ of their parts.


+ <img src="img/sboard.jpg" width=400 align=right>Technical papers are really a
  presentation of many connected technical concepts...
+ .... Some of which the reader will extract and apply to their own work.
+ So  we should not read papers so we can paint them again as beautiful complete works of art.
     + Rather, we treat them as a design of some complex product...
     + Which can be exploded into various parts...
     + ... each of which might be repurposed in other areas.

To put that another way, we should not _read_ papers but we should _survey_ them, to

+ Map out their structure
+ To find and extract whatever parts might be useful to use.

Of course, once we find the (little) bits that we really want to use, then we might spend hours/days struggling
to understand those (small) parts. But otherwise, we need to read _over_ papers, not _through_ them.
