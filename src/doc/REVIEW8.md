# Review 8: Transfer Learning for Defect Prediction

* What're pylint, pytest, unittest?
* Why and when defect prediction are used?
* Why data mining static code attributes works for defect prediction?
* What's the limitation of within-project defect prediction?
* What's the assumption of data mining?
* Briefly explain the key idea of transfer learning for defect prediction(HDP paper).
* Why KS test not other statistical tests(e.g. t-test) is used in this transfer learning paper?
* Why feature(metric) selection is applied here?
* Do you think transfer learning for defect prediction is a promising technique? Why?
