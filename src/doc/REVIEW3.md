### Simulated Annealing

  1. In a few lines, define ordered and unordered search. In what way are they different?
  2. In a few lines, compare and contrast: (1) Greedy search; (2) Local Search; and (3) Stochastic search. What, if any, are the trade-offs in using a Stochastic search?
  3. In about 10 lines, write down the pseudo-code for SA. Number each line.
  4. In the pseudo-code for SA, you used a probability function `P(e_new, e_old, t)`. What would be a valid mathematical expression for this. 
  5. With respect to function `P(e_new, e_old, t)`, justify the following statements:
      * Initially, SA is like a drunk, then it sobers up.
      * SA consumes lower memory.
  6. How would you terminate a stochastic algorithms such as SA sooner? (*HINT: Look at variances of epochs*)
