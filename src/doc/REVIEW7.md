# Review 7: Differential Evolution

- Explain: DE's build new examples by extrapolating between known ones.
- Explain the following DE constants:
- What is np and how is it used?
- What is cf and how is it used?
- What is f and how is it used?
- Write down, in 10 lines or less, pseudo-code for DE.
- Distinguish between the following two kinds of DE algorithms:
    + DE/rand/1
    + DE/best/2
