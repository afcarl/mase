FYI- the evil plan (by programmers) to take over the world is progressing nicely.  This book offers some programming details on that plan.

As all programmers know, the initial stages of the plan were completed years ago. Stage one was to adopt a meek and mild persona (possibly even boring and dull). 

Stage two was, using that persona, make our work essential to their day to day opertion of government and all industries (education, mining, manufacturing, etc etc). Looking around the world today, it is very clear that stage two was very successful.

After that, stage three was to open up more material to our inspection and manipluation. To this end, the entire planet was enclosed  a digital network- thus giving us unprecendented access to petabytes of sensors and effectors. Also, by carefully seeding a few promienet  examples of successful programmers (Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerburg), we convinced a lot of people to write lots of little tools, each of which represent or control some thing, somewhere.

Stage four Learn ways to simplify those  processes such that it becomes
   trivially fast to plan how to change them, in order to achieve
   your own goals. 
6. Deploy those changes, thus taking over the world.

Note the truly evil, very wicked and distrubring part of this plan:

+ If you have the power to change the world then that also means  (evil laugh) you    have the guilt if you do not use that power to right the wrongs in this world.  
+ So my gift to you is  discontent and struggle and the occasional (possibly fleeting) success against vast problems.
