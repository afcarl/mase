# Evil code (to take over the world, part4)



This book offers notes on part 5 of the programmer's guide to world domination. 



As you will recall, that plan is in 6 parts:

1. Adopt a meek and mild persona (possibly even boring and dull). 
2. Ingratiate yourself at all levels of government and all industries (education, mining, manufacturing, etc etc) 
   by make your work essential to their day to day opertions.
3. Connect the world in a digital network that gives you unprecendented access
   to information sources, updated every millisecond, from around the world.
4. Use those connections, and your centrailzed position within government and industry,  
   to collect data on seemingly complex processes.
5. Learn ways to simplify those  processes such that it becomes
   trivially fast to plan how to change them, in order to achieve
   your own goals. 
6. Deploy those changes, thus taking over the world.

Note the truly evil, very wicked and distrubring part of this plan:

+ If you have the power to change the world then that also means  (evil laugh) you    have the guilt if you do not use that power to right the wrongs in this world.  
+ So my gift to you is  discontent and struggle and the occasional (possibly fleeting) success against vast problems.
