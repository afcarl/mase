# Evil code (to take over the world, part4)

This book offers notes on part 4 of the programmer's guide to world domination. 
As you will recall, that plan is in 5 parts:

1. Adopt a meek and mild persona (optional: make it boring or dull). Make
   others shun you by  
   obsessing on millions of tiny details that seem obscure and arcane to
   others, but are actually key to build large and complex devices.
2. Ingratiate yourself at all levels of government and industry. Suggestion: make
   your work essential to their day to day opertions.
3. Connect the world in a digital network that gives you unprecendented access
   to information sources, updated every millisecond, from around the world.
   Hints and tips for increasing your data access:
   + Great a cult of social media where everyone reveals megabytes of information
     about themselves, all the time.
   + Build vast data stores that no one can probably secure (to test for that,
     count how many times one person witha  flash drive can walk away with 
     millions of supposedly top secret documents).
4. Learn ways to simplify seemingly complex processes such that it becomes
   trivially fast to plan how to change them, in order to achieve
   your own goals.
5. Deploy those changes, thus taking over the world.
