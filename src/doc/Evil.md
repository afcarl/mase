# Evil code (to take over the world, part4)

This book offers notes on part 4 of the programmer's guide to world domination. 
As you will recall, that plan is in 6 parts:

1. Adopt a meek and mild persona Hints and tips (optional, but highly recommended):
   + Make that persona boring or dull. 
   + Make others shun you by obsessing on millions of tiny details that seem obscure and arcane to
     others, but are actually key to build large and complex devices.
2. Ingratiate yourself at all levels of government and all industries (education, mining, manufacturing, etc etc) . Suggestion: 
   + Make your work essential to their day to day opertions.
3. Connect the world in a digital network that gives you unprecendented access
   to information sources, updated every millisecond, from around the world.
   Hints and tips for increasing your data access:
   + Great a cult of social media where everyone reveals megabytes of information
     about themselves, all the time.
   + Build vast data stores that no one can probably secure.
     + By the way, to test that your network is sufficiently insecure,  count how many times one person with
       a  flash drive can walk away with  millions of supposedly top secret documents).
4. Use those connections, and your centrailzed position within government and industry,  to collect data on seemingly complex processes.
5. Learn ways to simplify those  processes such that it becomes
   trivially fast to plan how to change them, in order to achieve
   your own goals. 
6. Deploy those changes, thus taking over the world.

Note the truly evil, very wicked and distrubring part of this plan. If you have the power to change the world then that means  (evil laugh) you also  have the guilt if you do not use that power to right the wrongs in this world.
