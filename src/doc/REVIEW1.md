## Theory

Can you define the following?

+ Evolutionary algorithms
  + Genetic algorithms
  + Genetic programsming
+ Evolutionary programs 101
  + Mutation
    + Can u give examples of GA mutation? of GP mutation?
  + Crossover
	+     + Can u give examples of GA crossover? of GP crossover
  + Selection
    + Binary domination
    + Pareto frontier (hint a diagram is good here)
      + spread
      + hypervolume

## Practice

For each of the following, can you offer a 3 line code snippet to demo
the idea?

+ Classes
+ Functions
+ Decorators
+ Static variables, functions
+ Scope
  + nested scope
+ functions
  + default params
  + variable lists args
  + variable dictionary args
  + lambda bodies
+ list comprehensions
+ decorators
